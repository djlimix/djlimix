### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I first got in touch with code when I was 11 years old. I started making websites with HTML & CSS, but soon I realised that frontend won't be good for me. I found out that there is something called backend, so I bought a PHP course and later Laravel course. And few years later, here we are, with you visiting my profile.

### So WHAT DO I DO?

With my friend, we build modern websites. He makes frontend which I then transform to React or Vue or Livewire and later build backend with Laravel. We have 5+ years of experience with making websites.
